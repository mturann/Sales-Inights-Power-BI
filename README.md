# Sales-Inights-Power-BI

This project includes the analysis and dashboards of the sales made by a company in India in the years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020. These dashboards help in examining past data and identifying steps and strategies to be taken for future direction. Dashboarding is great tool for these companies to maximize profit.

What issues I focused:
- The market is growing dynamically and the company is facing issues in terms of tracking the sales in this dynamically growing market 
- The company is having issues with the insights of his business
- lack of complete pictures 
- complexity of excell files 
- lack of digestable insights 
- Managers can take data-driven decision by the help of power bi visualizations
